## ü§ù Collaboration Rules
To maintain a clean and organized codebase, please follow these rules:

1. **No direct merges to `main` or `master`**  
   - All changes must go through a **Pull Request (PR)**.  

2. **Branching Strategy**  
   - Create a new branch for each feature, bugfix, or improvement.  
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/ocr-enhancement`, `fix/db-query-bug`).  

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**  
   - All contributions must be submitted via a PR.  
   - Ensure your PR has a clear title and description.  
   - At least **one review/approval** is required before merging.  

4. **Commit Guidelines**  
   - Write meaningful commit messages.  
   - Example: `fix: corrected certificate ID parsing bug`  
   - Avoid generic commits like `update` or `changes`.  

5. **Code Quality**  
   - Follow consistent coding style and formatting rules.  
   - Add comments where necessary.
